                Before deciding to dive head first into a career in tech, I spent 15 years as a Photography Producer, managing and seeking out new business opportunities in advertising for commercial photographers. This helped me develop strong analytical, problem solving and people skills within a creative environment, which I really enjoy.

                <p className="font-light my-1 mx-4">I learn and adapt to new and complex challenges quickly, and aim to continue growing and evolving.
                I'm keen to find my voice within the right tech role, where I can add value to a team. Ultimately, I'd love to continue developing my skills working on products and experiences that bring value to people's lives.</p>

                I'm passionate about music, and I love discovering new music and going to live shows. I'm also a keen football/sports fan, enjoy good food and wine, art/design, architecture, film and reportage photography.
